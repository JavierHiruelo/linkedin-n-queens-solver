# LinkedIn N-Queens Solver

This project provides an automated solution for the "Queens" game on LinkedIn, implementing a solver for the classic N-Queens problem.

## Description

The LinkedIn N-Queens Solver is a Python script that automates the process of solving the N-Queens puzzle in LinkedIn's "Queens" game. It uses web scraping techniques to interact with the game interface, solves the puzzle programmatically, and inputs the solution automatically.

Key features:
- Automated login to LinkedIn
- Web scraping to extract the game board
- Implementation of a backtracking algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem
- Automated input of the solution to the game interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Playwright
- BeautifulSoup4
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JavierHiruelo/linkedin-n-queens-solver.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install playwright beautifulsoup4 numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. Install the Playwright browsers:
   ```
   playwright install
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python N_Queens_Solver.py
   ```

2. When prompted, enter your LinkedIn username and password.

3. The script will automatically log in to LinkedIn, navigate to the Queens game, solve the puzzle, and input the solution.

## How it works

1. The script uses Playwright to automate browser interactions.
2. It logs into LinkedIn using the provided credentials.
3. The game board is extracted using BeautifulSoup.
4. The N-Queens problem is solved using a backtracking algorithm.
5. The solution is automatically input into the game interface.
